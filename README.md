# DesignPatterns

Creational Design Patterns

1. Singleton - It is used when the class has no state only behaviour.
2. Factory - 
3. Abstarct Factory - 
4. Prototype - 
5. Builder - 


Structural Design Pattern

1. Adapter - It is used when we are dealing with external Libraries like integrating Payment services like Juspay to our application
2. Flyweight - It is used when we are dealing with a lot of objects with a lot of simmilarities. Creating a lot of objects will require a lot of memory but as most of them have common attributes, this pattern will save memory
3. Decorator - It is used as a wrapper Pattern. Eg Pizza class.. Pizza can have multiple toppings but still after each process, it will remain as a pizza.
